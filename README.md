# Delicate Branch README

## Purpose
This branch ("delicate") is dedicated to deploying a modified version of Lt. Ouroumov's Worm CYOA for those who like to switch to light mode or turn off images. The modifications are relative to the latest version available on Lt. Ouroumov's website [here](https://cyoa.ltouroumov.ch/viewer).

## Credit
All credit for the original content goes to:
- Lt. Ouroumov
- Contributors in her Discord Channel

## Modifications
The changes made will be cataloged in this [file](https://github.com/DelicateIntegral/ltworm/blob/delicate/changelog.md)

## Notifications
